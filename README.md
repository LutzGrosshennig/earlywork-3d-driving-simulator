# earlywork-3d-driving-simulator

This is what I consider my first real C++ project written for an 386SX-16MHz PC (that where the PCs we had in the lab) between December 1994 and January 1995!
It was developed as a one month exercise while I studied CS back in thoose days. Prof. Dr. Ulrich Breymann http://www.ubreymann.de/ teached me how to programm in C++. 

I may add that I got the best possible score for this excerise.

You can watch a preview on Youtube right here:
