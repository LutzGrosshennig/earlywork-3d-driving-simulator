# earlywork-3d-driving-simulator

This is probably my very first C++ project written for an PC.
It was developed as an exercise while I studied CS between the 12-DEC-1994 and the 12-JAN-1995 (one Month)

# System requirements:

		- MS Dos 5.0 or higher
		- Intel 386SX 16Mhz with x87 Coprocessor 
		- VGA
		
		It will work just fine in DosBox!
