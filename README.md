# earlywork-3d-driving-simulator

This is was I consider my first C++ project written for an 386SX PC between December 1994 and January 1995!
It was developed as an one month exercise while I studied CS back in those days. Prof. Dr. Ulrich Breymann teached me how to programm in C++. 

I may add that it got the best possible score for this excerise.

You can watch it a preview on Youtube right here:
